    <!-- Inspired by my favorite childhood movies such as Fantasia, The Little Mermaid, Peter Pan, and The Sea Prince And The Fire Child, I wanted my Harmonic Collection to evoke a sense of nostalgia intertwined with the allure of fantasy. Additionally, I drew inspiration from the whimsical and imaginative artworks of Aya Takano, who artfully maintains a childlike perspective in her unique creations. My Harmonic Collection will be titled 'Exploring The Deep Sea,' as it encapsulates its enchanting essence set in an ethereal underwater realm.

Within this collection, my focal point resides within the mesmerizing marine environment and its captivating creatures. Every entry will have a vibrant and luminous color palette, artfully melding reality with fantasy. Each entry within this compendium is a distinct voyage into this magical domain, offering viewers an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of experiences. Some entries will delve into the intricacies of the marine ecosystem, others shall capture the resplendent beauty and enchantment that permeates this mystical world, and others will unravel the enigmatic tales of the creatures that call this sea their home.
